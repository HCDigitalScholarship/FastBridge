A newer faster Bridge 
Full reference documentation is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLF_AXg8-KjiQozGNCCo6V-dmIm8jeIk8udHJ8xuvkI/
Bridge provides several tools to help students of Ancient Languages – currently Latin and Greek, but hopefully Sanskrit, Armaiac, and Coptic will be added soon. 
Bridge has three main tools/apps: Lists, Oracle, and Lemmatizer. Lists helps make custom vocabularly lists, and Oracle gives the most familiar sections in an unfamiliar work.
Lemmatizer tries to do the boring part of lemmatizing texts, matching all the lemma that have only one possiblity.
